id is auto genreated with leadin Zeros 
all ids based on one basemodel so the last number is the total workers
ex:  N00125 => we have 125 workers not jus nurses

# save form {Nureses:[id:{},id:{}]
			 Doctors:[id:{}, id{}]}
# Notes to refresh memory while coding:
file : __init__.py => what for?
	 primarily marking a directory as a Python package and allowing for package initialization upon import
	Package Initialization: When a package is imported, Python executes the code in __init__.py. This can include initializing package-level variables, importing submodules, or executing setup code needed for the package to function correctly


what i done:
* did the ids for workers
* coded the file storage, base model and other workers class
* json => doing
* patient => waiting


* code run as db:

 echo 'create Doctor name="shaimaa" phone="01061674178" specialty="icu" department="icu2"' | MYSQL_USER=root MYSQL_PWD=password MYSQL_HOST=localhost MYSQL_DB=smart_care TYPE_STORAGE=db ./console.py

# code run for test:
 echo 'create Doctor name="shaimaa" phone="01061674178" specialty="icu" department="icu2"' | MYSQL_USER=root MYSQL_PWD=password MYSQL_HOST=localhost MYSQL_DB=smart_care_test TYPE_STORAGE=db ./console.py


MYSQL_USER=root MYSQL_PWD=password MYSQL_HOST=localhost MYSQL_DB=smart_care TYPE_STORAGE=db

MYSQL_USER=root MYSQL_PWD=password MYSQL_HOST=localhost MYSQL_DB=smart_care_test TYPE_STORAGE=db
